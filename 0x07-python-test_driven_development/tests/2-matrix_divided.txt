    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Div matrix which some of its elems aren't int/float numbers:

    >>> matrix_divided([[2.7, 4], ['6', 8.4], [10.1, '12'], [5.3, '10.2', 15.8]], 5)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    	      ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Pass matrix which one of its elems is empty list:

    >>> matrix_divided([[2.1, 5.8], [], [10, -3]], 8)

    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Pass div as a list

    >>> matrix_divided([[5.7, 8.1], [7.7, 4.9]], [2])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    	      ...
    TypeError: div must be a number

Pass div as a str

    >>> matrix_divided([[10, 50], [30, 20]], "10")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    	      ...
